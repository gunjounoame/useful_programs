# `useful_programs`

A library/collection of programs written in Java.

> **NOTE: As of July 24, 2021, I have decided to make each program their own separate project. Therefore, this repository is most likely out-of-date.**

## Production

**This project is still under production!** This means that not all of the programs will be stable. If you find any bugs, report them, and I will try my hardest to fix them as fast as I can (though I'm not that good of a programmer! :P).

Due to my schedule, this project may get updated very frequently sometimes and get no updates at all sometimes. Please take this into mind. Thank you.

## FAQ

Why does the repository name contain an underscore when it's written in Java?

> Because the very original versions of the project (you won't find it on GitHub; I developed it locally) only consisted of Python projects. I later reprogrammed everything to be written in Java, but the repository name is still in Python style.

Why are there two branches named `master` and `development`?

> The `development` branch is mostly used for development purposes (as the name suggests) and contains the newest source code for the project. However, this code may not be stable yet. For this reason, the `master` branch contains the latest *stable* source code.
